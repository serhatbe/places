Despite the weather forecasts, we bravely followed our long weekend plans. Only the first day was rainy, but we didn’t mind. You and your best friend, cruising along two great bikes through beautiful country—what more could you ask for?

Here are some of our highlights:

-   Passage through the North Cascades
-   Stay at the Best Western in Omak
-   The journey from Republic to Kettle Falls
-   Road along Roosevelt Lake
-   Grand Coulee Dam
-   Road along Banks Lake (we drove it three times and once before, for a total of four times)
-   Dry Falls
-   Mosses Lake
-   Pot Holes
-   Othello, with its many Mexican restaurants
-   I-90 through the Cascades
