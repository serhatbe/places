Our recent road trip through New Mexico was an unforgettable experience. After traversing 9,000 kilometres (5,600 miles) across eight states, we returned home on Canada Day safely and sound. The 22 days we spent on this adventure passed swiftly, yet we witnessed a plethora of captivating sights and were utterly enchanted by the state. Prior to embarking on this journey, New Mexico held a mystical allure for me, and that enchantment persists.

This time, our rides through Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada were exceptional. The weather was remarkably dry, with occasional heatwaves.
