We bought this Bluetooth headset in early February, 2011 for \$299.

We tried the intercom during our trip to the [Black Hills, South Dakota](https://continuum.codeberg.page/travel/pages/posts/2011-09-14/). Initially, we were frustrated with the user manual and spent a few days fiddling around with the headsets before giving up. However, we tried them again and finally managed to chat!
